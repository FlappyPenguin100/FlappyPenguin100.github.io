<p>Hello Everyone
  I'm working on learning coding. This is what I have produced so far. I am working on learning a lot of code with <a href="https://josephbanks.me">this person; Joseph.</a>
  Clicking that link will take you to his website where you can read more about him. If you want a discord bot then I suggest using.. <a href="https://pybutt.josephbanks.me">PyButt.</a>
  All websites linked in this site will take you to where they say, they are not adverts.</p>
